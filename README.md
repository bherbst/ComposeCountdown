## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a pretty basic countdown app right now- it just counts down from 2 minutes! It uses two
circular rings to track the seconds & minutes remaining. Coming soon: the ability to change the 
duration (wild, I know!).

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I was very happy with how the text animation turned out! I am somewhat happy with how the ring
animations turned out as well, but they need a little bit more love to get them where I want them to
be.
